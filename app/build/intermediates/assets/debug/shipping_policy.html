    <p>In short shipping rates are weight based. Weight of any product can be found on its detail
        page. To match the policies of the courier companies we use, all weights will be rounded up
        to the next 500 grams.</p>

        customer. We assure to take responsibility of any in-transit risk. If the courier company
        fails to deliver, then customers don't have to suffer any loss for the same. After parcel is
        delivered by courier Company at customer's place, incurring of lost, stolen or damaged then
        after, 1stchoice is not responsible for that.</p>
